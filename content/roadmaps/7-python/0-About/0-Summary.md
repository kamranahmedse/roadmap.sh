## How To Become A Python Developer?

Starting out in the quest to become a python developer, you must take a structured approach to master all your skills. Below is the list for the same:

### Python Fundamentals

* Variables And Data Types
* Data Structures And Algorithms
* Loops, Conditional And Control Statements
* I/O Operations And Exception Handling
* Modules And File Handling
* Database Knowledge

Starting with Python fundamentals, you must master all these basic concepts which is like a foundation for any programming language.
After mastering these concepts you can choose a career path for yourself and similarly work to master all the skills needed to achieve your goal.

### Web Frameworks

  * Django Or Flask
  * HTML, CSS
  * MVC-MVT Architecture
  * Server Side development
  * Front end skills
  * Script Writing

Mastering web frameworks and these concepts will lead you to become a web developer.
You can develop GUI based applications or web applications according to you specifications to master your skills.

### Towards Data Science

* Mathematics And Statistics
* Libraries( Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn)
* Data Visualization
* Interpretation and Data Analysis
* Manipulation of Data
* Database Knowledge

These concepts and skills will take you one step closer to becoming a data scientist.
For practice, you can take up a data-set and try to analyse and interpret the data. You can also make changes in the data-set to manipulate the data.

### Machine Learning And AI Concepts

* Machine Learning Algorithms
* Applied Mathematics and Statistics
* Libraries (Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras)
* Building Prediction Models
* Problem Solving Skills

These are the advanced learning concepts towards becoming a data scientist.
You can start your practice by making prediction models for a start. Take a data-set and try to predict the result using a logistic regression model. Below is a library that is used for machine learning.

### Deep Learning

* Neural Network Architecture
* Natural Language Processing

These concepts are a rather add-on or you may say advanced learning towards deep learning, which will help you become a deep learning engineer.
To see the reach of the performance with deep learning, Here is a graph for analysis. As you can see, the performance climbs exponentially with deep learning.

### Automation Testing

* Selenium Web Driver, IDE, Selenium Grid
* TestNG

With better programming skills, you can go a lot further when it comes to test automation. Building and designing python scripts for automation of processes.
Writing python scripts to check the functionality and testing the processes is something you can perform to master your automation skills.

### Miscellaneous skills

* Web Scraping Using Beautiful Soup, Requests library
* Computer Vision Using OpenCV

Now these are a few miscellaneous skills you can master that will help you become a better programmer. The practice of implementing the theory you learn, is the key to becoming a python developer.
The successful python developers would always suggest that the theory you learn should be the 20% of your total effort, rest of the 80% effort should go into implementing the theory you learn.
We have discussed the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ part for becoming a Python developer through this article, a structured approach and learning will get you to the goal easily if you follow the career path wisely.
